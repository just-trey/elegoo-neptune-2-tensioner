# elegoo-neptune-2-tensioner
These files are a copy of Elegoo's tensioner file. Some folks asked for this as the files are embedded in a word document and can be hard for some users to extract. It is my understanding that Elegoo has open sourced the printer so these files are not proprietary. 

I printed the original file and opted to use an M4x20 bolt and nut instead of the M4x35. I also do not recommend using the "pin" they provide for printing. I found it cannot handle the force. I used an M4x20 bolt screwed in from the back. It fits and works great for me.

__PLEASE NOTE: I am providing these files as a convenience and cannot be responsible for any issues or problems you have with them. If you print these files, espcially the provided `.gcode` files you are doing so at your own risk.__

### X-axis Belt Tensioner Assembly Guide

The adjustable X-axis belt tensioner can be upgraded without any extra parts. The following figure shows the assembly drawing of all the parts and the tensioning device used, just install it according to the assembly drawing. The following are the precautions before assembly, please read the precautions first:

Reminder: Please print the part model first. The gcode file is a sliced file. Please use PLA filament for printing. If you are using PLA filament, just move it to the TF card for printing. If you need to print separately, you can refer to the printing direction of the STL file in the red frame to print.

**Precautions:**
- Screw the disassembled M4 bolts into the holes before assembling; this process requires a lot of strength and patience. After the red hand-adjusted nut is processed, you need to add some lubricating oil (it can be used for lubrication. M4 nut is better, but it needs to be reamed).

- Do not use too much force when screwing the M4x35 bolts here, otherwise the thread will slip easily. Please refer to the picture for the screwing depth. (The use of M4x20 bolts here is more reasonable and beautiful)

- The movable slider is thick on one side and thin on the other side. Please see clearly before assembling.

-	Pass the belt first and then install the thumb nut
